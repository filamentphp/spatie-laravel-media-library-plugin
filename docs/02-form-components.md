You may use the field in the same way as the [original file upload](/docs/forms/fields#file-upload) field:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload;

SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload::make('avatar'),
```

The media library file upload supports all the customization options of the [original file upload component](/docs/forms/fields#file-upload).

> The field will automatically load and save its uploads to your model. To set this functionality up, **you must also follow the instructions set out in the [field relationships](/docs/forms/getting-started#field-relationships) section**. If you're using the [admin panel](/docs/admin), you can skip this step.

## Passing a collection

Optionally, you may pass a [`collection()`](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-medialibrary/working-with-media-collections/simple-media-collections) allows you to group files into categories:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload;

SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload::make('avatar')->collection('avatars'),
```

## Reordering files

In addition to the behaviour of the normal file upload, Spatie's Media Library also allows users to reorder files.

To enable this behaviour, use the `enableReordering()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload;

SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->enableReordering(),
```

You may now drag and drop files into order.

## Adding custom properties

You may pass in [custom properties](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-medialibrary/advanced-usage/using-custom-properties) when uploading files using the `customProperties()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload;

SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->customProperties(['zip_filename_prefix' => 'folder/subfolder/']),
```

## Generating responsive images

You may [generate responsive images](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-medialibrary/responsive-images/getting-started-with-responsive-images) when the files are uploaded using the `responsiveImages()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload;

SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->responsiveImages(),
```

## Using conversions

You may also specify a `conversion()` to load the file from showing it in the form, if present:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload;

SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload::make('attachments')->conversion('thumb'),
```

### Storing conversions on a separate disk

You can store your conversions and responsive images on a disk other than the one where you save the original file. Pass the name of the disk where you want conversion to be saved to the `conversionsDisk()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload;

SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload::make('attachments')->conversionsDisk('s3'),
```

## Storing media-specific manipulations

You may pass in [manipulations](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-medialibrary/advanced-usage/storing-media-specific-manipulations#breadcrumb) that are run when files are uploaded using the `manipulations()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload;

SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->manipulations([
        'thumb' => ['orientation' => '90'],
    ]),
```

## Optimizing images

Before uploading your image, you may choose to optimize it by converting to your chosen format. The file saved to your disk will be the converted version only.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload;

SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->image()
    ->optimize('webp'),
```

## Resizing images

You may also want to resize an image by passing in a percentage you would like to reduce the image by. This will also maintain aspect ratio.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload;

SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->image()
    ->resize(50),
```
